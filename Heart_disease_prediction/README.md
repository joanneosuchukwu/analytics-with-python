Heart Disease Prediction

Introduction
Cardiovascular disease is a leading cause of death in the world. Series of cardiovascular risk factors, clinical and investigation findings guide physicians in the diagnosis of different types of heart disease. However, with time and accuracy being of utmost importance in the diagnosis and treatment of patients, often times, the clinical signs and symptoms are silent, leading to missed, wrong or delayed diagnoses. In order to prevent heart disease, it is important to predict the chances of occurrence. The information age and advances in Machine Learning provide opportunities to do this. This classification problem compares five models that attempt to predict whether or not a patient will develop heart disease. The algorithms used are: RandomForestClassifier, LogisticRegression, DecisionTreesClassifier, XGBoost and SVM.
Aim
Aim: The classification task is to predict whether a patient will develop heart disease or not (given the available independent variables)
Data source
The dataset is publicly available on Kaggle and it comes from the University of California Irvine's Machine Learning Repository at https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Heart+Disease. It includes 270 rows and 14 columns
